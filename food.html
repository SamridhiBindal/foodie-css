            There are more than 600 different pasta shapes made around the world.
The word “pasta” comes from the Italian for paste, meaning a combination of durum wheat semolina and water.
Pasta existed for thousands of years before anyone ever thought to put tomato sauce on it. 
            Pasta served with bread
Most dried pasta is commercially produced via an extrusion process although it can be produced in most homes. Fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines,[5] but today many varieties of fresh pasta are also commercially produced by large-scale machines, and the products are widely available in supermarkets.

Both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented.[6] In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example, the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed and specialty or decorative shapes.[7] As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes.
